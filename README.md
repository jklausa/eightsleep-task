Hey there :)

This is my submission for the coding challenge. Few things to note:

â€” This is my first time writing a React Native code from scratch! I've contributed tiny bits to codebases before, but this was with established projects that had structure in place.
â€” I am a _terrible_ designer, so the end product looks... bad.

So, given this, a few words about the code:

â€” It's built on top of Expo, which everyone told me is the easiest way to start. It's... fine
â€” I am not super happy with the SVG charting library I ended up going with. It was recommmended to me by a friend, but it's... not super user friendly.
â€” I'm using typescript, because working for years in Swift and Objective-C has broken me and I can't use dynamically typed languages anymore.
â€” I tried using hooks whenever possible, since I understand that this is The React Way now. I might have gone overboard.
â€” I'm sure the code is horribly unidiomatic in a billion ways, and there's a easier/simpler way of doing a bunch of things. I'd love to learn about those :D


To launch:

â€” `npm install && npx expo` should get you going!

Anyway, thanks for reading this and considering me for the position!
